## Project Overview

TeQueenMatch is born out of a shared vision to create a digital space where individuals from underrepresented groups in the tech industry can connect, network, and foster mentorship relationships. We recognized the need for a platform that caters specifically to the unique experiences and challenges faced by women and non-binary individuals in tech.

### Features
- **User Profiles**: Create and customize your profile to highlight your interests, experiences, and preferences.
- **Matching Algorithm**: Our algorithm connects you with like-minded individuals in the tech community.
- **Networking**: Build meaningful connections and mentorship relationships.
- **Custom Styling**: We've invested in custom styling using vanilla CSS, giving us full control over the design.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Built with React.js for a responsive and interactive user interface.
- **Backend**: Powered by Node.js and MongoDB for robust data storage and retrieval.
- **State Management**: Utilizes Redux for efficient state management.
- **API Communication**: Axios is used for making API requests.
- **Styling**: Custom CSS styling for a unique look and feel.

## Development Process

TeQueenMatch was developed from the ground up by our dedicated team. We believed in its importance and worked tirelessly, even with some delays, to make it a reality within a three-week timeframe.

## Deployment

Currently, our server is deployed on Render. While it serves our needs, we acknowledge that it might not be the most efficient option for our project's demands. We are actively exploring other hosting platforms to enhance server performance.

## Future Improvements

We're committed to improving TechConnect continuously. Here are some areas we're focusing on:

- **Code Refactoring**: We recognize the need for code refactoring and will continue to enhance code quality.
- **User Experience**: We plan to implement loaders in appropriate places to enhance the user experience.
- **Middleware Handling**: We're working to gracefully handle middleware and ensure smoother operation.

Thank you for checking out teQueenMatch. We hope this platform makes a positive impact on underrepresented groups in the tech industry. If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to reach out. Together, we can make the tech community more inclusive and supportive.
